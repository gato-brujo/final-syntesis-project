<h3>Red and Blue-shift</h3>
<p>
  In physics and astronomy, redshift is a phenomenon that occurs when
  electromagnetic radiation that is emitted or reflected from an object, usually
  visible light, appears redshifted at the end of the electromagnetic spectrum.
  When we speak of redshift, what we are indicating is that the waves that are
  perceived are a little closer to the type of waves of greater amplitude (radio
  waves), while when we speak of blue shift we are referring to the opposite
  effect, i.e., we are closer to the waves of shorter length.

<h3>Red-shift</h3>
<p>
  Occurs when an electromagnetic wave (usually visible light), which is emitted
  from an object, is redshifted at the end of the electromagnetic spectrum. It
  should be noted that this redshift is an apparent increase in wavelength.
