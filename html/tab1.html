<h3>What is Red-shift?</h3>
<p>
  In physics and astronomy, red-shift is a phenomenon that occurs when
  electromagnetic radiation that is emitted or reflected from an object, usually
  visible light, appears redshifted at the end of the electromagnetic spectrum.
  When we speak of red-shift, what we are indicating is that the waves that are
  perceived are a little closer to the type of waves of greater amplitude (radio
  waves); redshift is the displacement of the spectrum of an astronomical object
  toward longer (red) wavelengths. It is attributed to the Doppler effect, a
  change in wavelength that results when a given source of waves (ex: light or
  radio waves) and an observer are in motion with respect to each other. The
  Doppler effect causes stars to take on a near-red hue from Earth, the farther
  away a galaxy is, and in the infrared, the redder it will appear (from the
  point at which they pass from red to infrared, they are no longer visible to
  the human eye).

<h3>
  What is Blue-shift
</h3>
<p>
  A phenomenon that occurs when the frequency of a ray of light emitted by an
  object, approaching or moving toward to the observer, is received by the
  observer shifted toward to blue, it means its frequency increased. When we
  speak of blue-shift we are referring to the opposite effect of red-shift, we
  are closer to the waves of shorter length and it shifts toward the blue end of
  the spectrum. Is the decrease in wavelength of electromagnetic radiation
  received by an observer approaching the source emitting the radiation. This
  event is used in astronomy to determine the motion of celestial objects
  relative to the Earth. If the object is bluish, it is most likely approaching.
  For example, if A yellow star, which emits light at approximately 600
  nanometers (nm), will appear blue (450 nm), if the observer approaches it at
  80,000 km/s. At speeds of the order of 99 percent of the light, both red and
  violet (the entire range of visible light) are converted to ultraviolet-ray XI
  radiation and are therefore not visible.

<h3>How to calculate and hubble constant</h3>
<p>
  The redshift, symbolized by z, is defined as: 1+z = observed/rest z=0.1. Note
  that if the observed wavelength were less than the rest wavelength, the value
  of z would be negative that would tell us that we have a blue-shift, and that
  the galaxy is approaching us. <br /><br />
  The universe is expanding. This expansion is currently occurring at a certain
  rate, which is measured by means of the Hubble constant, whose symbol is Ho.
  Its value is estimated to be about 70 kilometers per second per megap»ßrsec.
  Hubble's theory is also supported by the redshift and blueshift of the galaxy,
  which perfectly proves the constant proposed by Hubble.
