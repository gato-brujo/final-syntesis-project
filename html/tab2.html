<h3>CMBR</h3>
<p>
  In 1948, it was suggested that if the Universe started with an explosion,
  there should be microwave background radiation in space left over from the
  initial burst of energy. This radiation was discovered in 1964. It is called
  cosmic microwave background radiation or CMBR.<br /><br />

  CMBR is a second piece of evidence to show the expansion of space, and this
  supports the Big Bang model of the origin of the Universe. The short
  wavelengths of the gamma radiation emitted in the initial explosion are
  believed to have become stretched due to the expansion of space into longer
  wavelength microwaves

<h4>The Origin of the CMBR</h4>

<p>
  When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was
  denser, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of
  hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation
  filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons
  combined to form neutral atoms. These atoms could no longer absorb the thermal
  radiation, and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque
  fog. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as
  the recombination epoch, and the event known as photon decoupling which took
  place shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space
  rather than constantly being scattered by electrons and protons in plasma.<br />

  The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been
  propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the
  expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and
  wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planckâ€™s
  relation). This is the source of the alternative term relic radiation. The
  surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right
  distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from
  those points at the time of photon decoupling.

  submillimetre wavelengths outside the Milky Way
