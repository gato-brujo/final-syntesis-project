<h3>Big Bang Evidence</h3>
<p>
  The big bang theory is the one that astronomers use to explain the origin of
  the universe, it explains that everything began in a single point that
  suddently exploded and gave shape to the things we know that are in the
  universe nowadays. However, there are a lot of people that deny this theory,
  therefore in this article there is going to be some evidence of the big bang
  for those who are not completely convinced. <br />

<h4>Redshift of galaxies</h4>
<p>
  In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble declared that almost all galaxies seem to
  be moving away from us, in point of fact that was the first indicator that the
  universe was moving and expanding. Hubble used spectroscopic red-shift data to
  measure the speed in which objects in the universe were moving and the far
  they were from earth. He realized that the farther a galaxy is from us, the
  faster it is moving away from earth. So knowing that this redshift is from
  galaxies getting away from us if we went backwards in time we would see
  galaxies getting closer to us (we are getting closer to them as well), and if
  we were back enough all in the universe would be in the same place.
